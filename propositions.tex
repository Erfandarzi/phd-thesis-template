\begin{enumerate}
\item Researchers should study testing practices in a language which is actually testing-focused
  (such as Ruby) rather than Java, which seems to be the current default. [This thesis]
\item There is a dichotomy among OSS projects: Few projects are swarmed by contributions and do not
  know how to manage them anymore, whereas most barely get any, or if they do, they are not
  integrated because the project is already dormant. Paradoxically, both kinds of projects would
  benefit from automating their feedback loops. [This thesis]
\item Once we have uncovered or researched a new phenomenon empirically, we can never research it
  again from the same standpoint because we have interfered with it. [This thesis]
\item Most statistical results in published papers are wrong. [This thesis]
\item Empirical research published in papers only captures a static snapshot of current software
  development practices and is thus at best only of contemporary value. 
\item The fundamental problem of Empirical Software Engineering, in contrast to most other science
  fields, is its inherent lack of generality in the outcome measures that best describe different
  projects.
\item Anonymous reviewers are more likely to reveal themselves to the authors in the case of a
  positive outcome, creating a dependency of gratitude on the side of the author. Whether wanted or
  not, the Software Engineering research community is so inter-woven that severe conflicts of
  interest arise from this behavior.
\item Preregistration of studies would defend against review remarks saying that ``this is not an
  interesting finding'' and advance the state of science in Software Engineering.
\item Most citations are superficial and do not really embed or work with the cited paper.
\item Everybody in academia has his or her fundamentally own agenda in joint work. In most roles,
  this means doing as little work as possible, while participating in as many projects as possible,
  is beneficial. Hence, no real team work can ever exist in academia.
